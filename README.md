# Supervised Machine Learning: Credit Risk Assessment

## Contributor: Sam Espe

### Overview
This project was done as a submission for Homework #19 for Data Visualization and Analysis Boot Camp. In this project, I use two supervised machine learning algorithms to evaluate and make predictions on whether loan applicants will be approved for a loan. I used SciKit-Learn in a Jupyter Notebook to compare the performance of a logistic regression model to a random forest classification model. 

I used a provided data set of over 77,000 applicants to train and test both models. To compare the models, I calculated the accuracy, precision, and sensitivity of each model. I used the same train/test split for both models so they can be fairly evaluated. 

### Findings
I found that the two models were very closely matched in their accuracy and precision, but the logistic regression was more sensitive. The logistic regression was also much faster to run than the random forest classifier.
